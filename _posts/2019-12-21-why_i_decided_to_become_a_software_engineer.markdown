Up untill graduating high school, I hadn't put too much thought into what I wanted to do with my future. The expectation for me to go to school and get a degree was something that weighed heavy on me. I figured that when the time came to go to college that I would have it figured out, but I knew I didn' t know what I was going to do with my future, let alone if I wanted to go to school.

There was one thing I was certain about doing and this had all happened a year prior to me finishing high school. shortly after I turned 17 I called  a recruiter to join the Army National Guard. So by the time I graduated it would be time to leave for the army. The day I turned 18 I left to Fort Benning, GA to become a soldier. After a few long months of continuous hard work and training it was time to come home and commit to my duties and obligations.

Yet after returning I still needed to find a way to make a living. The National Gaurd is only a part time thing and I needed to start thinking about how I wanted to lay down the foundation for a career. Growing up I spent a lot of time playing video games, and I still do. I was always fascinated with computers and even built my own personal gaming PC. I thought that if I was going to do anything with my life that it would be with computers in one shape or another.

So coincidentally as I was trying to figure out what I wanted to do career wise, I came across and ad for Flatiron. It really caught my attention and I felt more convenient for me to learn online. I looked more into what the school had to offer and what it was all about and I felt that being in software engineering was for me. Sure enough I applied and now I aspire to make this my career. So hopefully this takes me where I want to go and it's successful.
